                             
I am a software engineer with a focus on distributed systems, particularly event-first architecture using microservices from **development** to **orchestration** - on various **Cloud Platforms**, **messaging/task** queues, **Observability and security**. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages including **Go, Java, C, Rust, and Python**. I am passionate about Linux system programming, security and especially BPF, which I used for monitoring, profiling and optimization in past projects using bpftrace, systemtap, libbpf. In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with FPGAs, Arduino, and ESP32 and have developed several projects that combine woodworking with electronics as part of my side project along with my wife.
