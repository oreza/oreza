Hi there! My name is Ovais and I am a software engineer with a focus on distributed systems, messaging/task queues, microservices. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages including Go, C, Rust, and Python and have experience with Linux system programming and security. I have also utilized BPF for optimization in past projects. In addition to my software skills, I am proficient in cloud technologies such as Kubernetes, Terraform, Packer, and Vault and have worked with cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure. I am well-versed in DevOps and Gitops tools such as Flux and ArgoCD. In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with FPGAs, Arduino, and ESP32 and have developed several projects that combine woodworking with electronics as part of my side business with my wife. Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!
